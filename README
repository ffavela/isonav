The isotope-navigator is intended to be a command line interface program
(for now) for making quick and easy calculations for nuclear reactions.

Given a reaction it gives the possible binary final reactions, and the
respective Q values, it sorts the output in terms of the Q values. Given
an angle and beam energy, it gives the energy of either the ejectile or
the resiual nucleus.

Currently, it has a limited isotope database which includes the masses
and it will include soon the levels of excitation.

You have to download the database for it to work, the dictionary can be
downloaded from:

Part of the ensdf files where loaded into a python dictionary.

Also a txt file called isoMasses.txt has to be downloaded.
