The isotope-navigator is intended to be a command line interface program
(for now) for making quick and easy calculations for nuclear reactions.

Given a reaction it gives the possible binary final reactions, and the
respective Q values, it sorts the output in terms of the Q values. Given
an angle and beam energy, it gives the energy of either the ejectile or
the resiual nucleus.

Currently, it has a limited isotope database which includes the masses
and it will include soon the levels of excitation.
