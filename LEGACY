Run with sudo the install script via

$ sudo ./installScript.sh

If you don't have the latest database the install script will try to
download it, if it fails then it will tell you what might be wrong and
where to download it manually in case the failing continues. Make sure
that "curl" is installed, for ubuntu users you can install it via:

sudo apt install curl

If you have an Mac computer and you get an "Operation not permitted"
error there is a work around, you'll need to disable the System
Integrity Protection. Simply reboot and press Cmd-R then open a
terminal and type "csrutil disable" (without the quotes) reboot and
run the install script again. It is encouraged to reenable it after
the installation is done.

In case you need uninstalling, simply do a:

$ sudo ./installScript.sh --uninstall

In case you don't want to install system wide, just make sure the data
directory is available (as well as docopt) and you run it with:

$ python isonav.py ...

As a setback, the scripts probably won't work as expected.
