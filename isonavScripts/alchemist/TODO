Correct the ordering bug with of the --opp option
for example, for the command:

$ alchemist hoyle.cor --opp S12 0
S12	16 17 15
S13	16 17 15

This can't be solved with simple ordering because
sometimes the values go through zero like in:

$ alchemist hoyle.cor --opp S12 15
S12	30 31 0
S13	30 31 0

Solve it by sorting with respect to the modulus
of the number of telescopes in the respective ring.

See if the function gives negative values, this might
help with the sorting.
