Solve this BUG!!:
$ isonav 197Au --Elab=64 --material=Si --thick=30
-1.000

But

$ isonav 197Au --Elab=0.001 --material=Si --thick=300
5884582.250

This makes no sense!!! BUG solved

Improve the documentation. Make a latex doc for the theory.

Make the interactive part of the program, less prone to errors.

Parse que extra data in the db (parity etc).

Add the relativistic scattering case.

Decays with excited states.

Improve the database, add half lifes, decay modes. Beta decay.
Add a get reference option.
Add a wikipedia parser for HF?
Add subnuclear particles?

Spectroscopic functions. Plotting stuff.

Testing cases for debugging.

# Use the database for masses and other properties from (suggested by
#    Silpion):

# https://www-nds.iaea.org/amdc/ame2012/mass.mas12
DONE!! (only for the masses)


Make a man page: example;  $ man isonav

Add coulomb energy for binary exit channels. DONE

Include an Elab option for looking up to which channels get opened.

Add additionally a sorting with respect of coulomb for the opened channels.

Add capability of printing higher order reactions (ternary, quaternary ...)
BUGS:

    isotopes with names 1950s and 1940s appear sometimes, for example:

        $ python isonav.py 235U --decay -v | head
         #Given an isotope, it gives all the possible decay schemes
         #res    daught          eRes    eDaugh  Q

No error... this also happens with p,t,d (not that there are but
still). Note the listed levels that are not 0.0 are theoretical, put
some flag for this.
